\exercise[1.13]
Let's define set \( A_i \) that contains all permutations of elements in set \( S = \set{ 1, 2, \dots{}, n } \) where \( i \)-th element is on its place.
\[ A_i = \set{ a_1 \dots{} a_i \dots{} a_n : a_i \in S ; \; a_i \; \text{is on its place} } \]

Let's find the cardinality of this set.
From the definition of the set we know that every element \( \)  has \( a_i \) that is in place
\textit{i}. But the positions of other \( a_j ,\; j \neq i \) doesn't matter, so take number of
permutations of these `other \(a_j\)` which is \( (n-1)! \).

\[ \abs{A_i} = (n-1)! \]

Using this built object we can find \( \omega_n \) -- number of set \( S \)
permutations where no number stays in it's place.

\[ \omega_n = P_t - P_s \]

\( P_t \) is total number of permutations of \textit{S} and \( P_s \) is number of permutations of
\textit{S} where exists an element that is in it's place.

Obviously:
\[ P_t = n! \]

And what about \( P_s \)? Let's construct a union of all \(A_i\)

\( \bigcup_{i=1}^{n} A_i \) such a union contains all permutations where an element that is in it's
place exists.

\[ \abs{\bigcup_{i=1}^{n} A_i } = \sum_{i=1}^{n}{\abs{A_i}} - \sum_{i<j}{\abs{A_i \cap A_j}} + \dots
+ (-1)^{n-1}\abs{\bigcap_{i=1}^{n}{A_i}}\]

Here we got a problem. We don't know the cardinality of intersections.

The intersection of two sets \(A_i\) and \(A_j\) contains all permutations where \textit{i}-th and
\textit{j}-th elements are in it's place. The way cardinality of \(A_i\) found we know that two
elemets stay in their positions and others can go anywhere. Find number of permutations with two
elements stay in place:
\[ \abs{A_i \cap A_j} = (n-2)! \]

Similarly for any number of intersections:
\[ \abs{\bigcap_{i=1}^{k}{A_i}} = (n-k)! \]

Last step for \textbf{Inclusion–exclusion principle} -- we need to do something with these sums.

When we used this principle the exact elements and distinction in sum's arguments were not
mentioned. So we only calculate numbers as long as cardinality is found using the statements
above.

So, the number of ways to pick one element from a set \(S\) is \( C_{n}^{1} \), for two elements --
\( C_{n}^{2} \) and so on:

\[ \abs{\bigcup_{i=1}^{n} A_i } = C_{n}^{1} (n-1)! - C_{n}^{2} (n-2)! + \dots + (-1)^{n-1}
    C_{n}^{n} = \]
\[ = \frac{n!}{1! (n-1)!} (n-1)! - \frac{n!}{2! (n-2)!} (n-2)! + \dots + (-1)^{n-1} = \]
\[ = n! - \frac{n!}{2!} + \dots + (-1)^{n-1} \]

Finally find \(\omega_n\):
\[ \omega_n = P_t - P_s = n! - n! + \frac{n!}{2!} - \frac{n!}{3!} + \dots + (-1)^{n} = \]
need to mention that here used \( - (-1)^{n-1} = (-1)^{n} \)
\[ = \frac{n!}{2!} - \frac{n!}{3!} + \dots + (-1)^{n} \]

Last step -- find \( p_n = \ddfrac{\omega_n}{n!} \):

\[ p_n = \ddfrac{\omega_n}{n!} = \frac{n!}{2! n!} - \frac{n!}{3! n!} + \dots + \frac{(-1)^{n}}{n!} =
\frac{1}{2!} - \frac{1}{3!} + \dots + \frac{(-1)^{n}}{n!} \]

\exercise[1.14]

First of all, define set of all learners, learners attending math class and 
learners attending physics class:

\[ A = \set{ a : \text{ \textit{a} -- learner } } ; \; \abs{A} = 35 \]
\[ M = \set{ m : \text{ \textit{b} -- learner and attends math class }} ; \; \abs{M} = 20 \]
\[ P = \set{ p : \text{ \textit{p} -- learner and attends physics class }}  ; \; \abs{P} = 11 \]
\[ N = \set{ n : \text{ \textit{n} -- learner and attends no classes } }; \; \abs{N} = 10 \]
\[ A = M \cup P \cup N \]

Find cardinality of \(A\):
\[ \abs{A} = \abs{M \cup P \cup N} \]

Use \textbf{Inclusion–exclusion principle}
\[ \abs{A} = \abs{M} + \abs{P} + \abs{N} - \abs{M \cap P} - \abs{M \cap N} 
- \abs{P \cap N} + \abs{M \cap P \cap N} \]

The \(N\) set is defined as set of non-attenders so there cannot be any intersections with sets
\(M\) and \(P\).

\[ \abs{A} = \abs{M} + \abs{P} + \abs{N} - \abs{M \cap P} \]
\[ 35 = 20 + 11 + 10 - \abs{M \cap P} \]
\[ \abs{M \cap P} = 20 + 11 + 10 - 35 = 41 - 35 = 6 \]

Number of students who attend math group and physics group -- 6.

And number of students attending only math group:
\[ \abs{M} - \abs{M \cap P} = 20 - 6 = 14 \]

\exercise*[1.17]

Using set of digits:
\[ D = \set{ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 } \]

Set of five-digit numbers divisible by 5 (the first digit cannot be 0):
\[ S = \set{ a_1 a_2 a_3 a_4 a_5 : a_1 \in D \textbackslash \set{0}, \; a_i \in D \;\; i =
\overline{2, 4}, \; a_5 \in \set{0, 5} } \]

We define \( a_5 \in \set{0, 5} \) in order to make a number divisible by 5.
So number of required numbers:
\[ \abs{S} = 9 \cdot 10^{3} \cdot 2 \]
