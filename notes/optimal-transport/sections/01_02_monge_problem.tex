\section{Monge Problem}

The first problem that may come into a mind is about transporting some mass from point $x$ into $y$.
The two densities (for $x$ and $y$) are $f$ and $g$ respectively. So we would like to find such
a map $T$ that is optimal.
The problem is:
\[ \min \int \left| x - T(x) \right| f(x) dx \]

Generalizing, we can consider other costs $c(x, y)$:
\[ \min \int c(x, T(x)) f(x) dx \]

But we want to work with measures $\mu$ and $\nu$
and get mass balance $\mu(\R^{n}) = \nu(\R^{n})$.

The thing to conserve mass may be written like this:
\[ \mu(T^{-1}(A)) = \nu(A) \;\; \forall A \subset \mathcal{Y} \] 

And then we can rewrite the Monge formulation of OT:
\[ \min \left\{ \int_{\R^{n}} c(x, T(x)) d\mu(x) \mid u(T^{-1}(A)) = \nu(A) \;\; \forall A \subset \mathcal{Y} \right\} \]

Discrete measures:
$$
\alpha = \sum_{i = 1}^{n} = \mathbf{a}_{i} \delta_{x_{i}}
\;\; \text{ and } \;\;
\beta = \sum_{j=1}^{m} \mathbf{b}_{j} \delta _{y_{j}}
$$

Seek for a map that associates to each point $x_{i}$ a single point $y_{i}$ and which must push the mass of $\alpha$ toward the mass of $\beta$:
$$
T: \{ x_{1}, \dots, x_{n} \} \to \{ y_{1}, \dots, y_{_{m}} \}
$$
$$
\forall j \in [[ m ]], \;\; \mathbf{b}_{j} = \sum_{i: T(x_{i}) = y_{j}} a_{i}
$$
compactly
$$
T_{\#} \alpha = \beta
$$

This map should minimize the transportation cost which is the sum of each single point transportation:

$$
\min_{T} \left\{ \sum_{i} c( x_{i}, T(x_{i}) )
\; : \;
T_{\#} \alpha = \beta \right\}
$$
